## 📏 How to Measure Tree Circumference (DBH)

### **What is DBH?**
**DBH** = Diameter at Breast Height  
**Measurement Height** = **1.37 meters (4.5 feet)** from ground level

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **Method 1: Manual Measurement (Most Accurate)**

1. **Find Breast Height**
   - Stand next to the tree
   - Measure **1.37 meters** (137 cm) from ground level
   - Mark this point on the tree trunk

2. **Wrap Measuring Tape**
   - Use a **fabric measuring tape** (not metal - it can hurt the tree)
   - Wrap tape **horizontally** around trunk at marked height
   - Keep tape **snug but not tight** against bark
   - Don't compress the bark

3. **Read Circumference**
   - Note where tape meets the starting point
   - Record measurement in **centimeters (cm)**

4. **Tips for Accuracy:**
   - ⚠️ If tree is on slope: Measure 1.37m from **uphill side**
   - 🌿 Remove any moss/lichen before measuring
   - 🔄 Measure again to verify
   - 📝 Typical ranges:
     - Small tree: 30-60 cm
     - Medium tree: 60-150 cm
     - Large tree: 150-300 cm
     - Very large tree: 300+ cm

---

#### **Method 2: Camera AI Measurement**

1. **Position Yourself**
   - Stand **2-3 meters** away from tree
   - Position at **breast height level** (1.37m)
   - Keep camera **perpendicular** to trunk

2. **Frame the Photo**
   - Tree trunk should be **centered** in frame
   - Capture trunk from ground to above breast height
   - Include some **reference context** (not just trunk closeup)
   - Good lighting - avoid harsh shadows

3. **Take Photo**
   - Click **"AI Camera"** button in app
   - Take photo or select from gallery
   - AI will automatically detect trunk at breast height
   - Shows: Circumference + Confidence level

4. **Best Results:**
   ✅ Clear, well-lit photo  
   ✅ Trunk visible at breast height  
   ✅ Camera held steady  
   ✅ 2-3 meters distance  
   
   ❌ Avoid blurry photos  
   ❌ Don't photograph leaves only  
   ❌ Not too close (distortion)  
   ❌ Avoid heavy shadows

## 📐 DBH Measurement Rules for Special Cases (FSI Standard)

Different tree conditions require different approaches. Always follow these FSI-prescribed rules for correct DBH measurement:

![DBH Measurement Rules](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202026-03-03%20at%203.09.25%20PM.jpeg)

---

### **(a) Normal Tree on Flat Ground**
- Measure at exactly **1.3 m** from ground level on any side.

---

### **(b) Tree on a Slope**
- Measure at **1.3 m from the uphill side** of the trunk.
- The uphill side is always the reference point — never the downhill side.

---

### **(c) Tree on a Concave/Eroded Slope**
- Same rule as (b): measure **1.3 m from the uphill base** of the trunk.
- If roots are exposed on the downhill side, ignore them and take the uphill base as ground level.

---

### **(d) Leaning Tree**
- Measure **1.3 m along the trunk** from the base (not vertically from the ground).
- Follow the trunk length, not the straight vertical height.

---

### **(e) Tree with Swelling or Irregular Trunk at 1.3 m**
- If the trunk has a **swelling, lump, or branch** at 1.3 m, **move the measurement point above** the irregularity.
- Measure at the **narrowest normal point** just above the swelling.

---

### **(f) Tree with Buttress Roots or Large Surface Roots**
- Buttress roots growing up the base can raise the effective trunk start.
- Measure **at least 30 cm above** the top of the buttress/roots.
- Measurement point must always be **more than 1.0 m from the ground**.
- If buttress is very tall (> 1 m), note it separately; consult FSI guidelines.

---

### **(g) Multi-Stem Tree — Stems Join Below 1.3 m**
- If multiple stems emerge from the same base **and join below 1.3 m**, measure **below the point where they join** as a single trunk.
- Treat it as one tree with one circumference.

---

### **(h) Multi-Stem Tree — Stems Split at or Above Ground**
- If stems **fork at or above ground level before 1.3 m**, measure **each stem separately at 1.3 m**.
- Record and calculate each stem as an individual tree, then sum the results.

---

### **Quick Reference Table**

| Situation | Where to Measure |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Flat ground, normal tree | 1.3 m from ground |
| Tree on slope | 1.3 m from **uphill** side |
| Leaning tree | 1.3 m along trunk length |
| Swelling/lump at 1.3 m | Above the swelling (narrowest point) |
| Buttress/large roots | 30 cm above buttress, minimum 1.0 m height |
| Multi-stems joining below 1.3 m | Below the join (single measurement) |
| Multi-stems forking before 1.3 m | Each stem separately at 1.3 m |

## 🌳 Species Selection

### **Why Species Matters?**
Different trees have different **wood density (ρ)**:
- **Heavy hardwood** (Sal, Tamarind): ρ = 0.80+ g/cm³
- **Medium wood** (Neem, Teak): ρ = 0.55-0.70 g/cm³
- **Light wood** (Peepal, Coconut): ρ = 0.45-0.55 g/cm³

Higher density = More carbon storage per unit volume!

### **Species Database:**
Our app includes **50+ Indian tree species** with accurate wood density values from FSI data:

| Species | Wood Density | Common Use |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Sal | 0.86 g/cm³ | Heavy hardwood, high CO₂ storage |
| Tamarind | 0.81 g/cm³ | Long-lived, excellent sequestration |
| Arjuna | 0.78 g/cm³ | Medicinal, dense wood |
| Neem | 0.68 g/cm³ | Medicinal, moderate density |
| Teak | 0.55 g/cm³ | Premium timber |
| Mango | 0.56 g/cm³ | Fruit tree, good carbon storage |
| Peepal | 0.51 g/cm³ | Sacred, 24hr oxygen |

## 🧮 Calculation Methods

### **Our Scientific Approach:**

We use **3 internationally recognized methods** calibrated for Indian forests:

#### **1. Chave et al. (2005) - Tropical Forests**
```
AGB = exp(-2.977 + 2.568 × ln(ρ × D²))
```
- Most widely used for tropical trees
- Validated across Asia, Africa, South America
- **Weight: 50%** in our calculation

#### **2. FSI Volume-Based Method**
```
AGB = Volume × Wood Density × BEF
BEF = 1.6 (Biomass Expansion Factor)
```
- Official Forest Survey of India method
- Based on Indian tree volume tables
- **Weight: 30%** in our calculation

#### **3. Brown (1989) - IPCC Pantropical**
```
AGB = exp(-2.134 + 2.530 × ln(D)) × (ρ/0.60)
```
- IPCC standard for pantropical regions
- Simple, reliable baseline
- **Weight: 20%** in our calculation

### **Final Formula:**
```
Final AGB = (Chave × 0.50) + (FSI × 0.30) + (Brown × 0.20)
```

## 🌱 Understanding Results

### **Biomass Components:**

1. **Above-Ground Biomass (AGB)**
   - Trunk, branches, leaves
   - Directly calculated from DBH

2. **Below-Ground Biomass (BGB)**
   - Roots system
   - **Small trees** (<20cm DBH): 25% of AGB
   - **Medium trees** (20-50cm): 20% of AGB
   - **Large trees** (>50cm): 15% of AGB

3. **Total Biomass**
   - AGB + BGB
   - All organic matter in tree

### **Carbon & CO₂:**

```
Carbon (kg) = Total Biomass × 0.47
CO₂ (kg) = Carbon × 3.67
```

**Why 0.47?**  
IPCC standard: 47% of dry tree biomass is carbon

**Why 3.67?**  
Molecular weight ratio: CO₂ (44) ÷ C (12) = 3.67

### **Oxygen Production:**

```
O₂ (kg/year) = Carbon × 2.67 × Activity Factor
```

**Activity Factor** varies with tree size:
- Young tree (<20cm): 0.8
- Mature tree (20-50cm): 1.0  
- Old tree (>50cm): 0.9
